## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile vs. Waterfall: Key Differences  

- Agile is flexible, iterative, and involves continuous feedback, making it ideal for evolving projects.  
- Waterfall follows a rigid, linear approach, best for well-defined projects with stable requirements.  

Pros & Cons:  
- Agile: Faster issue resolution, adaptable, but harder to predict costs.  
- Waterfall: Clear structure, easier budgeting, but changes are costly.  

Choosing the Right Approach:  
- Use Agile for dynamic projects needing frequent updates.  
- Use Waterfall for structured projects with fixed requirements.  
- Hybrid models can combine both for balance. 


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is more beneficial for projects that require flexibility, frequent changes, and ongoing collaboration. Examples include:  

- Software development startups Rapid iterations and user feedback help refine the product.  
- Mobile app development: Continuous updates and feature enhancements are needed.  
- E-commerce platforms: Changing market trends and customer needs require adaptability.  

Waterfall is better suited for projects with well-defined requirements, strict deadlines, and minimal expected changes. Examples include:  

- Infrastructure projects: Building bridges or highways where sequential phases are necessary.  
- Banking software: High security and regulatory compliance require detailed planning.  
- Enterprise software implementation: Large systems like ERPs need structured execution.  

Choosing the right methodology depends on project complexity, flexibility needs, and stakeholder involvement.
